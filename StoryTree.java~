      * 
      * Each node is named in a system that helps keep track of where 
      * in the tree it is. For example, the root of the story is text_1. The next 
      * node off of that is 1_1. At this point the first important decision 
      * is made by the player, and the tree branches into 1_1_1, 
      * 1_1_2, and 1_1_3. 1 represents the left-most branch then, and 
      * the highest final number represents the right-most branch.
      * 
      * OpeningNode is the root for the whole tree, and is the intro screen
